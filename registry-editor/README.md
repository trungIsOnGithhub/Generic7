#### What is Window Registry and how to use it?

Window Registry is a database of allsettings that Microsoft Windows, its applications, and hardware device drivers use to maintain configurations.

The Registry is a hierarchical database. Top of the hierarchy is your computer. Under that, you’ll find the main branches, aka “hives.” Within hives are Registry keys. Keys can contain sub-keys and Registry values.
